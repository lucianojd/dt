# `dt` (Data Transformer)

# History
I was trying to track my personal finances when I realized how tedious it was to manually enter each line item into a spreadsheet. I could export my financial statements as CSV file, but each financial institution had their own structure for the document and data. I created `dt` to be a reliable application for converting one CSV schema and the entries in the file into another schema.

# Introduction
`dt` takes either a file or directory as input along with a configuration file in `.json` format.
